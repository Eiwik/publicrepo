Nights in White Satin (оригинал The Moody Blues)

- - - - -
Nights in white satin, never reaching the end,

Letters I've written, never meaning to send.

Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before.

Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore.


'Cos I love you, yes I love you, oh how I love you.


Gazing at people, some hand in hand,

Just what I'm going through they can't understand.

Some try to tell me, thoughts they cannot defend,

Just what you want to be, you will be in the end.


And I love you, yes I love you,

Oh how I love you, oh how I love you.


Nights in white satin, never reaching the end,

Letters I've written, never meaning to send.

Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before.

Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore.


'Cos I love you, yes I love you,

Oh how I love you, oh how I love you.

'Cos I love you, yes I love you,

Oh how I love you, oh how I love you.


Breath deep the gathering gloom

Watch lights fade from every room

Bedsitter people look back and lament

Another day's useless energy spent


Impassioned lovers wrestle as one

Lonely man cries for love and has none 

New mother picks up and suckles her son

Senior citizens wish they were young


Cold hearted orb that rules the night

Removes the colours from our sight

Red is gray and yellow white

But we decide which is right and which is an illusion

Breath deep

The gathering gloom

Watch lights fade

From every room

Bedsitter people

Look back and lament

Another day's useless

Energy spent


Impassioned lovers

Wrestle as one

Lonely man cries for love

And has none

New mother picks up

And suckles her son

Senior citizens

Wish they were young


Cold hearted orb

That rules the night

Removes the colours

From our sight

Red is gray and

Yellow white

But we decide

Which is right

And

Which is an Illusion
